# JavaScript TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error and its solution.  The `bug.js` file contains code that throws a `TypeError` when attempting to access the `length` property of an undefined variable. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that handles both `null` and `undefined` values gracefully.
